Project Overview
The Amazon Bot is a Python-based automation tool that helps users track and monitor product prices and availability on Amazon. This project uses web scraping techniques to gather real-time data on product prices, ratings, and stock levels. The bot can be customized to send alerts when specific products drop in price or experience significant changes in details. It's designed for users who want to stay informed on their favorite items without manually checking Amazon's website.
